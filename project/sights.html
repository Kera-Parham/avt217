        <p class="sight1text">
          The Grossmünster Church is a former monastery built on the graves of
          the city’s patron saints, Felix and Regula, and is the site of the
          first secondary school, which according to legend, was founded by
          Charlemagne. His statue stands on top of the south tower, the
          Karlsturm. From the nave, 187 steps lead up to the viewing platform.
          The strenuous climb is well worthwhile: at the top, six large
          panoramic windows allow a beautiful view over the Old Town and the
          lake. The terraces are closed for safety reasons.

        <p class="sight1text">
          Founded in 853 by King Louis the German, this church with its convent
          was inhabited by the female members of the aristocracy of Europe. The
          convent enjoyed the patronage of kings and the abbess the right to
          mint coins in Zurich until well into the 13th century. Ownership of
          the church and convent passed to the city of Zurich after the
          Reformation.

          At 871 meters (2,858 feet) above sea level, the Uetliberg towers over
          the rooftops of Zurich. From the top, visitors are treated to a
          magnificent panoramic view of the city, the lake, and the Alps. The
          Uetliberg is particularly popular in November, as its summit is often
          above the blanket of fog that frequently envelops the city at this
          time of year. In winter, the hiking trails are transformed into
          toboggan runs, while in summer, the mountain is a popular departure
          point for well-marked hikes and mountain bike tours.

          the past, it was mainly used as a traffic and transportation route,
          but today it is a popular excursion destination for swimming, sailing,
          boating, and picnicking on the shore.

          Lindenhof was also the scene of numerous historical events. In the 4th

          grandson of Charlemagne built a regal palace as place of residence on
          the very same site.This area continued to be a place for gatherings
          for Zurich’s inhabitants right up to the beginning of the modern era.
          For example, the oath sealing the Helvetic Constitution was taken on
          the Lindenhof in 1798.
