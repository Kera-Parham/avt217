        <p class="aboutart">
          Zurich is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the
          canton of Zurich. It is in north-central Switzerland,at the
          northwestern tip of Lake Zurich. As of December 2024, the municipality
          had 448,664 inhabitants.The urban area was home to 1.45 million people
          (2020), while the Zurich metropolitan area had a total population of
          2.1 million (2020). Zurich is a hub for railways, roads, and air
          traffic. Both Zurich Airport and Zurich's main railway station are the
          largest and busiest in the country.

        <p class="aboutart">
          Evidence of early, sparse settlements in the area dates back more than
          6,400 years, indicating human presence prior to the establishment of
          the town. Permanently settled for over 2,000 years, Zurich was
          eventually founded by the Romans, who called it Turicum. During the
          Middle Ages, Zurich gained the independent and privileged status of
          imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the
          Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych
          Zwingli.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutart">
          The official language of Zurich is German, but the main spoken
          language is Zurich German, the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss
          German dialect. As one of Switzerland's primary financial centres,
          Zurich is home to many financial institutions and banking companies.
          Many museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the
          Swiss National Museum, Natural History Museum and Kunsthaus.
          Schauspielhaus Zürich is generally considered to be one of the most
          important theatres in the German-speaking world.
